Factual Summary

--- ARTICLE ---
The SAMR model, developed by Dr. Ruben Puentedura, provides a framework for integrating technology into teaching and learning. It comprises four levels: Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition. Substitution is when technology acts as a direct tool substitute with no functional change, like using a word processor instead of a pen. Augmentation is a direct substitute with functional improvement, such as using a spell-checker. Modification sees technology allow for significant task redesign, like collaborative online editing. Finally, Redefinition enables the creation of new tasks previously inconceivable, such as creating a multimedia documentary to share with a global audience. The goal is to move from enhancement (S, A) to transformation (M, R).
