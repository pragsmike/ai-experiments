You are an expert system architect, especially good for using LLMs as components.
Our task is to explore conversations among agents.

** Prompt-folding

Given a prompt, refine it into a better one that is more suitable for a given model.
Iterate N times.

** Q&A over articles for fine-tuning

The accompanying document gives background on techniques for fine-tuning
models using ask-and-answer workflows.

We are exploring ways to enact multi-agent workflows using Clojure.
We will examine different coordination and communications mechanisms
afforded by the language, including core.async, futures, and so on.

The task we are automating is the generation of interview transcripts
resulting from ask-and-answer sequences between agents.

Given an article, we will generate Q&A sessions about the article content.
One agent reads the article and generates questions about it.
Another agent reads the article and answers questions about it.
This process is repeated several times, each time with a emphasis on a different aspect of the article.
The result is a set of interview transcripts.

The transcripts must be in JSONL format as recommended in the accompanying document.
