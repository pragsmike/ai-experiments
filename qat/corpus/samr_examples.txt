Here are concrete examples of how the SAMR model is used in classrooms, illustrating each of its four levels—Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition—across various subjects and grade levels:

## **Elementary Reading Example**
- **Substitution:** Students read ebooks instead of physical books, using platforms like Epic or MackVIA.
- **Augmentation:** Students use built-in text-to-speech features to listen to the book, enhancing accessibility.
- **Modification:** Students create a book trailer using tools like Animoto or Pixton, integrating media and storytelling.
- **Redefinition:** Students participate in virtual book clubs with peers from other states or countries via video conferencing, sharing insights and perspectives beyond their classroom[1].

## **Middle School Science Example**
- **Substitution:** Researching ecosystems using online databases instead of library books.
- **Augmentation:** Taking notes with word processors, utilizing features like color-coding, images, and hyperlinks.
- **Modification:** Creating screencast videos to present research findings, allowing for narration and multimedia integration.
- **Redefinition:** Sharing presentations with environmental experts via live video conferencing and receiving real-time feedback, connecting classroom learning to real-world experts[1].

## **High School History Example**
- **Substitution:** Watching a pre-recorded lecture instead of attending a live one.
- **Augmentation:** Using interactive slide decks (e.g., Google Slides with Pear Deck) that include embedded comprehension questions for immediate feedback.
- **Modification:** Exploring interactive Learning Maps with videos, audio, maps, and quizzes, enabling self-paced, personalized learning.
- **Redefinition:** Taking a virtual reality field trip to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, offering immersive experiences not possible in a traditional classroom[1].

## **General Writing Assignment Example**
- **Substitution:** Typing essays on a computer instead of handwriting them.
- **Augmentation:** Using word processors with spellcheck and grammar tools.
- **Modification:** Collaborating on documents in real time using cloud-based tools, enabling peer feedback and revision.
- **Redefinition:** Creating multimedia presentations or digital stories that combine text, video, and audio, or sharing work globally for authentic audiences[2][3][4][5].

## **Assessment Example**
- **Substitution:** Taking quizzes online instead of on paper.
- **Augmentation:** Using interactive quizzes that provide instant feedback.
- **Modification:** Designing assessments where students create digital portfolios or screencasts to demonstrate understanding.
- **Redefinition:** Students record and reflect on their own presentations, or connect with global audiences to present their findings[6][5].

## **Summary Table of SAMR Classroom Examples**

| Level          | Example Activity                                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Substitution   | Reading ebooks instead of print; typing essays instead of handwriting                            |
| Augmentation   | Using text-to-speech; interactive slides with embedded questions                                 |
| Modification   | Collaborative writing in Google Docs; screencast presentations                                   |
| Redefinition   | Virtual field trips; global virtual book clubs; sharing projects with experts beyond the school  |

These examples demonstrate how educators use the SAMR model to progressively integrate technology, moving from simple substitutions to transformative learning experiences that would be impossible without digital tools[1][4][5].
