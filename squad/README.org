This experiment has Gemini generating code for a turn-based game played by a squad of LLMs.

The code implements a program known as the director.

   * [[prompt-1.org][prompt-1]] is the first prompt I gave it
   * [[prompt-2.org][prompt-2]] is the revised prompt rewritten by Gemini
   * [[roberts-game.txt][roberts-game.txt]] the prompt for the planner agent to design the Roberts Rules game
