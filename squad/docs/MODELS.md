That's fantastic news that `make test` passes and `make simulate` runs correctly! It's a huge milestone to have the core orchestration and simulation working.

You're right to anticipate challenges with real LLMs, especially concerning:
1.  **Strict JSON adherence:** Ensuring all keys are double-quoted strings, all values are correct JSON types, and the structure is perfectly formed.
2.  **Correctly updating game state:** This involves understanding the current state, applying their action logically, and producing a *complete and valid* new state, including managing `dialog_history` and `next_player_to_act`.
3.  **Instruction following and role-playing:** Consistently acting according to their assigned role and objectives within the game rules.

**Regarding good "desktop" models (run via Ollama) for the PLAYER role from your list, here's a recap of the recommendations, keeping in mind they need to balance capability with reasonable speed for interactive play:**

**Strong Candidates for the Player Role (balancing capability and speed):**

1.  **`mistral:latest` (Mistral 7B, 32k context):**
    *   This was your initial plan for players, and it remains a very solid choice. It's well-regarded for instruction following and general reasoning at its size. The 32k context is ample. This is often a great starting point.

2.  **`llama3:latest` (Llama 3 8B Instruct, 8k context):**
    *   Llama 3 8B Instruct is a top performer in its class. It generally excels at instruction following and producing coherent output. If `mistral:latest` struggles with JSON or complex instructions, Llama 3 8B would be my next recommendation to try for players. It might be slightly more robust.

3.  **`mistral-nemo:12b` (Mistral Nemo 12B, 16k context):**
    *   If your desktop can handle a 12B parameter model smoothly, this is likely to be a step up in capability from the 7B/8B models. Mistral fine-tunes are often very good. This would likely improve JSON adherence and nuanced play.

**Good Alternatives / Things to Consider:**

*   **`gemma:latest` (Gemma 7B, 8k context):** Another strong 7B model. Can be a good alternative if you want to compare or if one of the others isn't performing as expected.
*   **`qwen2:7b` or other Qwen 7B/8B variants (like `qwen1.5:8b` if you still have it or `qwen2:8b` becomes available):** Qwen models have shown strong capabilities, especially in multilingual contexts, but also generally good instruction following. Worth considering if the primary Mistral/Llama options have issues.

**Models to be more cautious with for the player role (due to size/complexity trade-off for this task):**

*   **Smaller models (< 7B, e.g., `phi3`, `qwen2:0.5b/1.5b`, `gemma2:2b`, `stablelm2:1.6b`):** While some (like Phi-3) are surprisingly capable for their size, they are statistically more likely to make errors in complex JSON generation and instruction following compared to 7B+ models. You'd likely need more retries and validation.
*   **Very Large Models (e.g., `mixtral:8x7b`, 70B models):** While highly capable, they will be significantly slower for each player turn. If turn-by-turn interaction speed is important, these might make the game feel sluggish unless you have a very powerful desktop GPU setup. `mixtral:8x7b` is probably the most "efficient" of the very large ones.

**Strategy for Real Model Testing:**

1.  **Start with `mistral:latest` (Mistral 7B) for your players.** This is a good, widely used baseline. Your planner prompt already mentions targeting Mistral models.
2.  **Iterate on Prompts:** If you get malformed JSON or incorrect state updates:
    *   **Re-examine the player instructions** generated by your planner (`gpt-3.5-turbo`). Are they crystal clear about the JSON structure, quoting of keys, and how to update specific fields like `next_player_to_act`?
    *   Consider adding even more explicit examples of the *exact JSON structure* they must return within the player instructions.
    *   You might even add a "self-correction" step to the player's instructions: "Before outputting your final JSON, double-check that all keys are double-quoted strings and that the JSON is valid."
3.  **If prompt iteration isn't enough, try a slightly more capable player model:**
    *   Switch players to `llama3:latest` (8B Instruct).
    *   If that's still not quite there and your hardware allows, try `mistral-nemo:12b`.
4.  **Implement Output Validation:** In your `director.play` module, after receiving the response from the player LLM and *before* trying to use `(:new_game_state player-response)`, you could add a validation step:
    *   Check if `(:new_game_state player-response)` is a map.
    *   Check for the presence of essential keys like `:dialog_history`, `:next_player_to_act`.
    *   If validation fails, you could log the error and potentially implement a retry mechanism (e.g., re-prompt the same player with an additional message like "Your previous response did not produce a valid new_game_state. Please ensure all keys are double-quoted strings and the entire structure is correct JSON. Your new_game_state was: [problematic state]. Please try again."). This adds resilience.

Your current setup with `gpt-3.5-turbo` as the planner and `mistral:latest` (7B) as the players is a very reasonable starting point for real model runs. Good luck, and I'm here if you hit new issues or want to discuss refinement strategies!
